- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - get a good average fps algorithm going
  - issues:
    - resetting after a missile is exploded causes its payload to stay behind
    - not able to edit player 2
    - dirt should probably be marked as stale when it dies?
    - turret is too good at shooting down missiles

  - pheromones
    - marked dirt should be a pheromoneSource
    - allow pheromoneEmitters to emit dispersing pheromones
  - minimap rendering functions too


- - - - - - BARE BONES - - - - - -
  - coal entity
    - onFire property
    - when on fire, gives off heat, loses hp, and glows
    - can catch on fire when near heat
  - iron entity/pheromone
    - turns to iron pheromone at temperature
    - viscosity property so it flows differently than water
  - steel entity/pheromone
    - higher melting point?
    - more hp than iron
  - turbine entity
    - spun in the presence of moving fluid
      - spins faster the higher the concentration is
      - increases fluid viscosity leftOvers underneath it
    - powerProducer property
    - power tracking at base level
    - power need from towers
      - powerConsumer property


- - - - - - LATER - - - - - - - -
  - system for creating missiles
    - pick launch location that's far away with actual ballistics trajectory
    - could have multiple "launch platforms" tuned to target the screen


- - - - - - - TO DRAW - - - - - -
  - add cracked stone tilesheet for hp counting
  - steel tilesheet
  - coal tilesheet
  - iron tilesheet
  - turbine

- - - - - - - TO THINK ABOUT - - - - - - -
  - temperature
    - water -> steam -> water (-> ice)
    - solid iron -> molten iron
    - coal + molten iron -> molten steel
    - fire
  - crafting
    - towers
    - turbines
    - how to convey crafting recipes
      - e.g. tower comes from steel (and?), where does steel come from
  - agent roles
    - drill
    - train
    - digger/shoveller
    - engineer?


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - worm
    - worm sprite indexing off-by-one when controlled?
    - worm should be able to double back on itself when stuck


- - - - - - - REFACTORS - - - - - - -
  - pheromone refactor to allow 0 values
    - getPheromoneAtPosition everywhere
    - setPheromone checking for undefined value
    - deleting the pheromone when you get to 0?
