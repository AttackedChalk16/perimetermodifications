- - - - - - ISSUES - - - - - -
  - turbines still don't spin super readily
  - water cycle is really water negative
    - happening when steam goes through diagonals?


- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - electron
    - windows
      - build with npm run make -- -p win32
      - needs .ico favicon
      - needs proper path to the icon in package.json
    - mac
      - build with npm run make
      - needs icns favicon


- - - - - - NICE-TO-HAVE - - - - - - - -
  - leaderboard with most missiles survived?
  - HUDs
    - show on position info card whether location is placeable/collectable
    - flicker resources when you spend them
  - plants
    - leaves + stalks
    - catch on fire at a lower temperature and turn to coal?
    - age and die as oil?
  - procedurally generate level:
    - random seed
    - randomize pocket shape a little more
  - ways to have additional interaction with terrain/environment
    - water wears away dirt over time
    - other forms of heat?
  - gravity
    - needs to start stable
    - needs to have a notion of connected components
      - so that two neighbors can't just hold each other up
      - so that you can make chambers that don't fall in
  - fog of war
    - fog entity that renders on top of the underground parts of the world
    - whenever something is collected or destroyed, remove fog in a certain radius
  - sound effects
    - missile explosion
    - explosion that damages one of your buildings
    - placing resources/buildings


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - fluids not coming out of a single horizontal opening
  - coal:
    - can strand molten pheromones that don't interact with anything
  - turbines:
    - spin direction depends on left/right-hand side of turbine
    - acceleration may work better than speed for e.g. contradictory flows
    - reducing pherToGive doesn't actually slow down an array of turbines
  - bullets can shoot through 1-thick walls


- - - - - - - REFACTORS - - - - - - -
  - pheromone refactor
    - getPheromoneAtPosition everywhere
    - setPheromone checking for undefined value
    - deleting the pheromone when you get to 0
    - remove playerID concept from pheromones?


- - - - - - - WON'T FIX - - - - - -
  - molten iron isn't preserving its quantity when condensing
    (when viscosity > 0)
    - it ends up creating an additional entity underneath
  - resetting the world after firing a bunch of missiles can cause error
    in collisionsAtSpace when the missiles blow up on each other
  - when pheromone emitters that are bigger than 1x1 dies, it doesn't clear the
    whole pheromone footprint
