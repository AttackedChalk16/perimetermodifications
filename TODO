- - - - - - ISSUES - - - - - -
  - tower not unpowering even though there's no power being produced
  - coal:
    - sometimes placing iron near hot coal leaves molten iron behind that doesn't
      follow physics
    - sometimes placing iron above hot coal produces iron and steel
      - this is because it's firing again
      - can I make it so it only fires one time?
    - iron + coal can be iron-negative (ie produces less steel than iron that went in
    - coal placed directly on molten iron deletes both and leaves heat
  - sand
    - appears to fade away to nothing upon melting to molten_sand
    - molten sand cools to glass in wrong locations?
    - collecting glass breaks pheromones
  - don't render marquee when placing pheromone
  - placing resources
    - have placing dirt mark its neighbors as stale correctly
  - resource collection
    - what about collecting entities with lower hp?
      - if they don't switch to agent, then they block pheromones
      - same problem with coal and its fuel
      - maybe everything should just accumulate/concentrate w/hp
    - removing dirt should also mark neighbors as stale
  - visually indicate whether individual turrets are powered or not
  - turbines:
    - spin direction depends on left/right-hand side of turbine
    - acceleration may work better than speed for e.g. contradictory flows
    - reducing pherToGive doesn't actually slow down an array of turbines
  - missiles coming from the right will be really hard to shoot down


- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - add coolConcentration to HUDs
  - show on position info card whether location is placeable/collectable
  - laser turret that requires a lot of power
  - make a level that combines all the resources
  - shouldn't be able to place resources/buildings on background
  - steam
    - if steam cool rate is less than water heat rate then clouds might form
    - set higher threshold for steam before it condenses back to water


- - - - - - BARE BONES - - - - - -
  - oil
    - separate pheromone for oil on fire?
      - how is heat produced from this?
    - can be separated into sulphur?


- - - - - - LATER - - - - - - - -
  - HUDS
    - render the entity in the cards for the HUDS
  - turrets
    - missile turret that requires additional resources to fire
  - explosives:
    - pre-render what an explosion under the mouse would look like
    - render horizontal/vertical explosions differently
  - sulphur
    - separated from oil somehow?
    - just mined like sand?
  - uranium
    - constantly produces heat
  - dynamite = coal + sulphur?
  - ice entity
    - getTemp helper function for heat calculations
    - how to allow melting AND different water freezing on?
  - get a good average fps algorithm going


- - - - - - - TO THINK ABOUT - - - - - - -
  - "god" mode instead of agents:
    - configurable explosives for clearing areas
    - "base" where resources are accumulated
    - mouse interactions:
      - what about pheromones like water/oil/sand?
      - palette for each type of resource to place in the world
        - basic resources:
          - dirt, stone, coal, iron, steel, sand, glass, silicon
        - structures
          - explosives, turbines, turrets
      - collecting resources
        - only collecting resources that are "connected" to the base?
        - including dirt that you can just click
        - could animate it being sucked into the base
      - fire starter of some sort (lighter, explosives?)
    - how are resources delivered to the base?
      - trains?
        - how do you load stuff onto a train?
      - if there's a path to the base you can just click it to collect it?
        - how to visualize this path to make it understandable?
  - ways to have additional interaction with terrain/environment
    - water wears away dirt over time
    - explosives as a base building mechanic
  - crafting
    - towers
    - turbines
    - how to convey crafting recipes
      - e.g. tower comes from steel (and?), where does steel come from
  - agent roles
    - drill
    - train
    - miner/digger/furnace shoveller
    - engineer
    - demolitions expert


- - - - - - - TO DRAW - - - - - -
  - add cracked stone tilesheet for hp counting
  - steel tilesheet
  - coal tilesheet
  - iron tilesheet
  - fire
  - turbine
  - missile
  - warheads
  - bullets
  - later
    - drill
    - train engine + cars


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - after passing iron over hot coal breaks pheromones everywhere
    - fixed for now by just not allowing this
  - bullets can shoot through 1-thick walls
  - when pheromone emitters that are bigger than 1x1 dies, it doesn't clear the
    whole pheromone footprint
  - resetting the world after firing a bunch of missiles can cause error
    in collisionsAtSpace when the missiles blow up on each other
  - worm
    - worm sprite indexing off-by-one when controlled?
    - worm should be able to double back on itself when stuck
  - clicking top and bottom bars
    - allow pass-through wherever possible
    - then don't have to remove them when paused in editor?
  - molten iron isn't preserving its quantity when condensing
    (when viscosity > 0)
    - it ends up creating an additional entity underneath


- - - - - - AGENT-BASED MECHANICS - - - - - -
  - HUDs
    - infoHUD
      - should also say what agents are holding
    - HUD for selecting marquee type
      - marqueeMode property
        - needs to override handlers from levelEditor
        - checking for handlers in mouseControlsSystem doesn't work
        - dropDown UI in HUD
      - mark for drilling
      - mark for pickup
      - mark for putdown
      - mark for blueprint
      - marked dirt should be a pheromoneSource
        - by changing quantity from 0
  - drilling agent
    - attacks marked entities
    - marked entities should switch to pheromone emitters dynamically?
      or can they always be pheromone emitters?
  - engineer agent(s)
    - marking pickup/putdown
    - marking blueprints to construction things
      - and marking building materials?


- - - - - - - REFACTORS - - - - - - -
  - pheromone refactor to allow 0 values
    - getPheromoneAtPosition everywhere
    - setPheromone checking for undefined value
    - deleting the pheromone when you get to 0?
