- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - get a good average fps algorithm going
  - steam
    - if steam cool rate is less than water heat rate then clouds might form
    - set higher threshold for steam before it condenses back to water
  - issues:
    - bullets can shoot through 1-thick walls
    - base for player 2 undefined
    - infoHUD
      - mouse.curPos can stop being up to date?
      - should also say what agents are holding
    - indicate whether individual turrets are powered or not
    - turbines:
      - spin direction depends on left/right-hand side of turbine
      - acceleration may work better than speed for e.g. contradictory flows
      - reducing pherToGive doesn't actually slow down an array of turbines

  - pheromones
    - marked dirt should be a pheromoneSource
      - by changing quantity from 0
    - allow pheromoneEmitters to emit dispersing pheromones
  - minimap rendering functions too


- - - - - - BARE BONES - - - - - -
  - HUDs
    - HUD for selecting marquee type
      - marqueeMode property
        - needs to override handlers from levelEditor
        - checking for handlers in mouseControlsSystem doesn't work
        - dropDown UI in HUD
      - mark for drilling
      - mark for pickup
      - mark for putdown
      - mark for blueprint
  - drilling agent
    - attacks marked entities
    - marked entities should switch to pheromone emitters dynamically?
      or can they always be pheromone emitters?
  - engineer agent(s)
    - marking pickup/putdown
    - marking blueprints to construction things
      - and marking building materials?


- - - - - - LATER - - - - - - - -
  - ice entity
    - getTemp helper function for heat calculations
  - system for creating missiles
    - pick launch location that's far away with actual ballistics trajectory
    - could have multiple "launch platforms" tuned to target the screen


- - - - - - - TO DRAW - - - - - -
  - add cracked stone tilesheet for hp counting
  - steel tilesheet
  - coal tilesheet
  - iron tilesheet
  - fire
  - turbine
  - missile
  - warheads
  - bullets
  - later
    - drill
    - train engine + cars

- - - - - - - TO THINK ABOUT - - - - - - -
  - ways to have additional interaction with terrain/environment
    - water wears away dirt over time
    - explosives as a base building mechanic
  - temperature
    - water -> steam -> water (-> ice)
    - solid iron -> molten iron
    - coal + molten iron -> molten steel
    - fire
  - crafting
    - towers
    - turbines
    - how to convey crafting recipes
      - e.g. tower comes from steel (and?), where does steel come from
  - agent roles
    - drill
    - train
    - miner/digger/furnace shoveller
    - engineer
    - demolitions expert



- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - resetting the world after firing a bunch of missiles can cause error
    in collisionsAtSpace when the missiles blow up on each other
  - worm
    - worm sprite indexing off-by-one when controlled?
    - worm should be able to double back on itself when stuck
  - molten iron isn't preserving its quantity when condensing
    (when viscosity > 0)
    - it ends up creating an additional entity underneath


- - - - - - - REFACTORS - - - - - - -
  - pheromone refactor to allow 0 values
    - getPheromoneAtPosition everywhere
    - setPheromone checking for undefined value
    - deleting the pheromone when you get to 0?
