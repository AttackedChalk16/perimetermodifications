  - issues:
    - missile:
      - rotating erratically
      - original rendering is off
        - have only ant render at 90deg?
      - moves too slow and in too straight a trajectory
      - drawn path not aligned with center of entity
      - reseting with a missile in the world breaks on held warhead

  - pheromones
    - marked dirt should be a pheromoneSource
    - allow pheromoneEmitters to emit dispersing pheromones
  - minimap rendering functions too


- - - - - - BARE BONES - - - - - -
  - entities:
    - missile
      - system for creating them
        - pick launch location that's far away with actual ballistics trajectory
        - could have multiple "launch platforms" tuned to target the screen
    - bullet
    - tower
  - properties:
    - ballistic
      - velocity, theta
  - actions:
    - shoot
    - aim

- - - - - - - TO DRAW - - - - - -
  - add cracked stone tilesheet for hp counting
  - steel tilesheet

- - - - - - - TO THINK ABOUT - - - - - - -
  - how to convey crafting recipes
    - e.g. tower comes from steel (and?), where does steel come from


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - worm
    - worm sprite indexing off-by-one when controlled?
    - worm should be able to double back on itself when stuck


- - - - - - - REFACTORS - - - - - - -
  - pheromone refactor to allow 0 values
    - getPheromoneAtPosition everywhere
    - setPheromone checking for undefined value
    - deleting the pheromone when you get to 0?
