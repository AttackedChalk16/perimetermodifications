- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - get a good average fps algorithm going
  - steam
    - if steam cool rate is less than water heat rate then clouds might form
    - set higher threshold for steam before it condenses back to water
  - issues:
    - allow wasd/arrowkeys to move screen when game is playing
    - indicate whether individual turrets are powered or not
    - turbines:
      - spin direction depends on left/right-hand side of turbine
      - acceleration may work better than speed for e.g. contradictory flows
      - reducing pherToGive doesn't actually slow down an array of turbines
    - dirt should probably be marked as stale when it dies?

  - pheromones
    - marked dirt should be a pheromoneSource
      - by changing quantity from 0
    - allow pheromoneEmitters to emit dispersing pheromones
  - minimap rendering functions too


- - - - - - BARE BONES - - - - - -
  - iron entity/pheromone
    - properties:
      - meltable
        - have heatQuantity be divided by hp
      - coolsToEntity pheromone property
        - worker needs to tell client there's a new entity
      - combinesTo pheromone property
        - check for presence of other ingredients
    - turns to iron pheromone at temperature
    - viscosity property so it flows differently than water
    - molten iron pheromone that turns back into iron entity
  - steel entity/pheromone
    - higher melting point?
    - more hp than iron


- - - - - - LATER - - - - - - - -
  - system for creating missiles
    - pick launch location that's far away with actual ballistics trajectory
    - could have multiple "launch platforms" tuned to target the screen


- - - - - - - TO DRAW - - - - - -
  - add cracked stone tilesheet for hp counting
  - steel tilesheet
  - coal tilesheet
  - iron tilesheet
  - fire
  - turbine
  - missile
  - warheads
  - bullets
  - later
    - drill
    - train engine + cars

- - - - - - - TO THINK ABOUT - - - - - - -
  - ways to have additional interaction with terrain/environment
    - water wears away dirt over time
    - explosives as a base building mechanic
  - temperature
    - water -> steam -> water (-> ice)
    - solid iron -> molten iron
    - coal + molten iron -> molten steel
    - fire
  - crafting
    - towers
    - turbines
    - how to convey crafting recipes
      - e.g. tower comes from steel (and?), where does steel come from
  - agent roles
    - drill
    - train
    - miner/digger/furnace shoveller
    - engineer
    - demolitions expert



- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - resetting the world after firing a bunch of missiles can cause error
    in collisionsAtSpace when the missiles blow up on each other
  - worm
    - worm sprite indexing off-by-one when controlled?
    - worm should be able to double back on itself when stuck


- - - - - - - REFACTORS - - - - - - -
  - pheromone refactor to allow 0 values
    - getPheromoneAtPosition everywhere
    - setPheromone checking for undefined value
    - deleting the pheromone when you get to 0?
