- - - - - - ISSUES - - - - - -
  - need to be able to right click through the bottom bar, especially on laptops
  - highlight the square under the cursor
  - zoom:
    - start a little more zoomed out
    - set a zoom limit to before the aspect ratio messes up
  - missile turret:
    - your own bullets hit your missiles
  - pheromones:
    - colony pheromone is getting injected into playerID 0 somehow
      - when ice is formed or melted
    - remove playerID concept from pheromones?
    - should just render via canvas
  - sand:
    - pheromones need to be able to block each other so that molten sand can
      live on top of regular sand
      - config for which pheromones you block
      - helper function for sorting isOccupied
  - coal:
    - can strand molten pheromones that don't interact with anything
  - turbines:
    - spin direction depends on left/right-hand side of turbine
    - acceleration may work better than speed for e.g. contradictory flows
    - reducing pherToGive doesn't actually slow down an array of turbines


- - - - - - SIMULATION - - - - - -
  - plants
    - leaves + stalks
    - catch on fire at a lower temperature and turn to coal?
    - age and die as oil?
  - oil
    - needs a separate tileIndex sprite
    - separate pheromone for oil on fire?
      - how is heat produced from this?
  - procedurally generate level:
    - random seed
    - randomize pocket shape a little more


- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - HUDS
    - flicker resources when you spend them
    - render the entity in the cards for the HUDS
    - hovercard for recipes above placement selectors?
    - add coolConcentration to HUDs
    - show on position info card whether location is placeable/collectable
    - count of missiles survived


- - - - - - LATER - - - - - - - -
  - mode with no missiles
  - visually indicate whether individual turrets are powered or not
  - cause game loss when base is killed
  - steam
    - if steam cool rate is less than water heat rate then clouds might form
  - explosives:
    - pre-render what an explosion under the mouse would look like
    - render horizontal/vertical explosions differently
  - uranium
    - constantly produces heat
  - get a good average fps algorithm going


- - - - - - - TO THINK ABOUT - - - - - - -
  - ways to have additional interaction with terrain/environment
    - water wears away dirt over time
    - other forms of heat?
  - crafting
    - how to convey crafting recipes
      - e.g. tower comes from steel (and?), where does steel come from


- - - - - - - TO DRAW - - - - - -
  - add cracked stone tilesheet for hp counting
  - steel tilesheet
  - coal tilesheet
  - iron tilesheet
  - fire
  - turbine
  - missile
  - warheads
  - bullets
  - later
    - drill
    - train engine + cars
  - melting animation to replace food


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - after passing iron over hot coal breaks pheromones everywhere
    - fixed for now by just not allowing this
  - bullets can shoot through 1-thick walls
  - when pheromone emitters that are bigger than 1x1 dies, it doesn't clear the
    whole pheromone footprint
  - resetting the world after firing a bunch of missiles can cause error
    in collisionsAtSpace when the missiles blow up on each other
  - worm
    - worm sprite indexing off-by-one when controlled?
    - worm should be able to double back on itself when stuck
  - clicking top and bottom bars
    - allow pass-through wherever possible
    - then don't have to remove them when paused in editor?
  - molten iron isn't preserving its quantity when condensing
    (when viscosity > 0)
    - it ends up creating an additional entity underneath


- - - - - - - REFACTORS - - - - - - -
  - pheromone refactor to allow 0 values
    - getPheromoneAtPosition everywhere
    - setPheromone checking for undefined value
    - deleting the pheromone when you get to 0?
