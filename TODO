  - get a good average fps algorithm going
  - issues:
    - resetting after a missile is exploded causes its payload to stay behind
    - not able to edit player 2
    - dirt should probably be marked as stale when it dies?
    - turret is too good at shooting down missiles

  - pheromones
    - marked dirt should be a pheromoneSource
    - allow pheromoneEmitters to emit dispersing pheromones
  - minimap rendering functions too


- - - - - - BARE BONES - - - - - -
  - system for creating missiles
    - pick launch location that's far away with actual ballistics trajectory

  - add cracked stone tilesheet for hp counting
  - steel tilesheet

- - - - - - - TO THINK ABOUT - - - - - - -
