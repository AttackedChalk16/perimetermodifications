  - pheromone spread
    - use getPheromoneAtPosition everywhere
    - don't store COLONY: 0, etc. on every single grid cell
  - stacking an action MUST be paired with critterStartCurrentAction which is
    a big gotcha
  - NxM entities don't render well with how I'm doing rotations, see renderTermite
  - could be nice to encapsulate entities in a single file
  - way to execute action at the END of the animation instead of the start
    - problem with effect index is stacking e.g. TURN won't check if this is needed until
      the effectIndex

  - get types file back up to date
  - config
    - add Config type to types.js
    - does canvasWidth/Height need to be on global config?
      - config in mouseSystem
  - get optional chaining working
  - refactor blocking types to live on the caste/type like actions do
  - need to refactor s.t. payloads on actions are always objects -- since if payload is
    e.g. the queen, then she has frameOffset and can mess up the rendering
  - ant diagonal movement
    - getting entity positions based on dir alignment in gridHelpers
      - either doesn't matter, or only for MxN
    - ants can pass through diagonal gaps
